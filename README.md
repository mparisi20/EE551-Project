# EE551 Project

The goal of this project is to make a Discord Weather Bot. 

This Bot will be able to connect to a Discord server and listen for particular commands:
- !weather: return today's forecast in Hoboken, NJ
- !weather <n>: return the n-day forecast for Hoboken, NJ. n's value must be between 1 and 7
- !weather <location>: return today's forecast for a given municipality

In addition, the last two options above may be combined in one line to retrieve the n-day forecast for a given municipality.
